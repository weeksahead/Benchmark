# Add Delete Button to Posted Blogs

## Analysis Summary

I've completed a thorough search of the codebase to identify all relevant files for adding a delete button to posted blogs. Here's what I found:

### Current System Architecture

**Blog Display Component:**
- `/Users/mitchfelderhoff/Developer/Benchmark-Equipment/components/PostedBlogs.tsx` (lines 20-513)
  - Displays blog list with filtering and sorting
  - Has Edit button for each blog (line 298-304)
  - Edit modal already exists (lines 318-461)
  - Fetches blogs from `/api/blog-posts` (line 47)

**Database:**
- **Table:** `blog_posts` in Supabase
- **Schema:** `/Users/mitchfelderhoff/Developer/Benchmark-Equipment/supabase-schema.sql` (lines 1-58)
  - Has RLS policies already configured
  - DELETE policy exists (lines 41-44): "Authenticated users can delete blog posts"
  - Uses service role key for admin operations

**API Routes:**
- `/Users/mitchfelderhoff/Developer/Benchmark-Equipment/app/api/blog-posts/route.ts` - GET only (fetches all blogs)
- `/Users/mitchfelderhoff/Developer/Benchmark-Equipment/app/api/blog-update/route.ts` - PUT only (updates blogs)
- **NO DELETE ROUTE EXISTS YET** - We need to create this

**Authentication:**
- `/Users/mitchfelderhoff/Developer/Benchmark-Equipment/components/AdminLogin.tsx` (lines 21-27)
  - Simple username/password check (admin/benchmark2024)
  - No session management or auth tokens
  - Admin dashboard requires login

**Supabase Clients:**
- `/Users/mitchfelderhoff/Developer/Benchmark-Equipment/lib/supabase.ts` - Public client (anon key)
- `/Users/mitchfelderhoff/Developer/Benchmark-Equipment/lib/supabase-admin.ts` - Admin client (service role key, bypasses RLS)

**Admin Dashboard:**
- `/Users/mitchfelderhoff/Developer/Benchmark-Equipment/components/AdminDashboard.tsx` (lines 44-800)
  - Contains PostedBlogs component (lines 790-793)
  - User must be logged in to access

## Implementation Plan

### Task List

- [ ] 1. Create DELETE API route at `/app/api/blog-delete/route.ts`
  - Accept blog post ID in request body
  - Use `supabaseAdmin` client (bypasses RLS)
  - Return success/error response
  - Model after existing `/app/api/blog-update/route.ts`

- [ ] 2. Add delete functionality to PostedBlogs component
  - Add state for delete confirmation modal
  - Add delete button to each blog card (next to Edit button)
  - Create confirmation modal (to prevent accidental deletes)
  - Call the new DELETE API endpoint
  - Refresh blog list after successful deletion
  - Show success/error messages

- [ ] 3. Add delete button to Edit modal (optional but recommended)
  - Add delete button at bottom of edit modal
  - Use same confirmation flow
  - Close modal after deletion

- [ ] 4. Update UI with delete button styling
  - Use Trash2 icon (already imported in PostedBlogs.tsx)
  - Red/destructive button styling for visibility
  - Confirmation modal with warning text

## File Changes Required

### New Files:
1. `/Users/mitchfelderhoff/Developer/Benchmark-Equipment/app/api/blog-delete/route.ts` - NEW

### Modified Files:
1. `/Users/mitchfelderhoff/Developer/Benchmark-Equipment/components/PostedBlogs.tsx` - MODIFY
   - Add delete handler function
   - Add delete confirmation modal
   - Add delete button to blog cards
   - Add delete button to edit modal (optional)

## Security Considerations

- ✅ Database has DELETE policy requiring authentication
- ✅ Using `supabaseAdmin` client which bypasses RLS (appropriate for admin operations)
- ✅ User must be logged in to AdminDashboard to access PostedBlogs
- ✅ No additional auth needed - existing admin login protects this feature

## Testing Checklist

After implementation, test:
- [ ] Delete button appears on each blog card
- [ ] Clicking delete shows confirmation modal
- [ ] Canceling confirmation does nothing
- [ ] Confirming deletion removes blog from database
- [ ] Blog list refreshes after deletion
- [ ] Success message displays
- [ ] Error handling works if deletion fails
- [ ] Deleting from edit modal works (if implemented)
